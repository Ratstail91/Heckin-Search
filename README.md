# Heckin-Search

I'm working here, heck off!

Yes, this code is a mess. I've ripped out the tests, and compacted it down into a mud pile, to let me rework the layout. This includes mangling and renaming a bunch of stuff, and I haven't refactored it into a more readable form yet.

It does seem to work, at least for the moment.

## Things

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install ruby
sudo gem install jekyll
```
